I am a doctoral student in the Psychology Department at Harvard University working in the [Intergroup Neuroscience Laboratory](http://http://www.intergroupneurosciencelaboratory.com/) directed by [Mina Cikara] (https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/mina-cikara). I investigate the psychological mechanisms underlying bias and discrimination in social decision-making. I am interested in creating scalable interventions to reduce harm and increase equity.

I am part of [The Rising Over Oppression Through Solidarity (ROOTS) Project, Inc.] (http://inclusiveroots.org/), based in New Jersey. Our organization is dedicated to using a multidimensional approach with children, educators, and families to create a more equitable and inclusive society. Each summer, we hold a week-long residential program for high school students where we build community in order to develop tools to challenge bias, bullying, and oppression as well as create growth plans to catalyze change at personal, interpersonal, and systemic levels.
